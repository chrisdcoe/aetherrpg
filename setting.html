                <img class="img-class" src="img/floating_islands_2.jpg" alt="Floating Islands"></img>
                <p>The landscape of Aether is drastically different from what we know in reality. Gone are the vast continents and oceans of our world; instead the people of Aether live on islands floating in the sky. The sky is filled with them; look out in any direction and you will see many other islands, both large and small.</p>
                <p>Above you is sky, bright and sunny most of the time with occasional clouds bringing precipitation. Below you is the Mist, a dense, opaque cloud-like layer. The Mist is magically charged and allows very little to fall through it; most people and objects are buoyant in the Mist and simply float to the surface.</p>
                <p>It's very unclear what is below the Mist. While stories have been told of places where the Mist is thin enough to see and pass through, these places are best avoided: something that falls through the Mist would not be able to come back up.</p>

                <h4>Mana Crystals</h4>
                <img class="img-class-left" src="img/crystal.jpg" alt="Mana Crystal"></img>

                <p>A curious aspect of the world of Aether is the mana crystals found all over the place. There are four primary types: earth, water, air, and fire crystals. Each is found growing organically in a different sort of environment, and each can be used in different ways.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Earth</span>: Earth crystals tend to be found in rocky areas such as mountains or caves. Particularly mountainous islands sometimes have mining camps established for the purpose of acquiring these crystals. Their most common use is in strengthening structures, handicrafts, and keeping weapons durable.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Water</span>: Water crystals are naturally found in the water, unsurprisingly. What may be a surprise is that these crystals actually appear to be the source of rivers, streams, and lakes on the islands. Due to their ability to create and manipulate water, these water crystals are handy to have on a long voyage to stay hydrated. They can also be used for cooling.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Air</span>: Air crystals only grow in high places. Typically this means they will be found on the smaller islands that float high above the Mist. They are unusually lightweight. Craftsmen have discovered that infusing air crystals into construction and equipment can make them nearly weightless, but this can be fairly expensive.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Fire</span>: Fire crystals are the most rare of the crystals, but they're arguably the most useful. It is difficult to find them in nature; they only grow where things have burned. Thankfully innovations have led to the development of facilities that can produce these crystals. Fire crystals are warm to the touch and can be used to burn things. They're extremely useful as fuel for airships.</p>

          <h3>The Core Lands</h3>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-12">
                <p>Very little of the world of Aether is currently charted. Civilization is confined to a circular region about 100 miles in radius. Given the diversity in people, one can imagine most of this land is already settled. Wars have often been waged over land disputes. In fact, the most recent war ended 25 years ago. Things are peaceful these days, and the peoples of the Core Lands have more or less come together in unity. But things are getting pretty crowded...</p>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-6">
                <h4>The Crystal Spire</h4>
                <p>At the center of the Core Lands is a huge crystalline structure called the Crystal Spire. It is a towering pillar of crystal that reaches hundreds of feet high and stretches down deep into the Mist.</p>
                <p>Civilization essentially formed around the Spire given its obvious role in navigation. The Spire serves another purpose, however: it projects a magical barrier in a 100 mile radius, protecting those within range from dangerous monsters and elemental entities. Thus, within the protection of the Spire, your biggest threats are pirates and other miscreants.</p>
                <p>Legends tell of massive leviathans, powerful demons, and even ancient dragons beyond the reach of the Spire. It's up to adventurers to verify these stories.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="col-6">
                <h4>New Concord</h4>
                <p>The seat of civilization in the Core Lands is a city called New Concord. It was built on a large island that sits right in front of the Crystal Spire. Originally it was a human-built military base strategically built in a territory war against the Tengu. As part of the peace treaty, the city became independent territory and was named New Concord as a show of good faith and optimism for unity.</p>
                <p>Nowadays, New Concord is home to members of all races. Roughly 2/3 of the population is comprised of humans, tengu, and ratlings. Minotaurs, orcs, maakiin, and lizan make up the rest.</p>
                <p>One of the most defining features of New Concord is the presence of Guilds. The Guilds have grown in power and prominence alongside the rise of New Concord, and a council of thirteen guild leaders called the Guild Council rules the city. Decisions are made by putting them to a council vote.</p>

              <img src="img/fantasy-airship.jpg" class="img-tabs">
              <h4>Airships</h4>
              <p>What would a world full of floating islands be without the presence of airships? This ubiquitous vehicle is the primary form of transportation around Aether. They come in all shapes and sizes, from huge warships and galleons to smaller barges and caravels.</p>
              <p>With the advent of gunpowder, many airships these days are equipped with cannons. Thankfully in an era of peacetime such as the present day, they are rarely put to use except as a deterrent for pirates. It's likely they'll find new use beyond the protection of the Crystal Spire.</p>
              <p>The technology that goes into airships is complicated; only the ratlings truly understand how everything works. What's important however is the understanding that airship furnaces are powered by fire crystals. Without them, airships would not be able to fly, and instead they would be confined to sailing on the surface of the Mist as in the olden days.</p>

              <h4>Firearms</h4>
              <p>Basic firearms are in use in Aether. While they are fairly strong, their cost can be a barrier for inexperienced adventurers. Additionally, much like crossbows, they require special training (i.e. the Crossbow Expert feat) to be used to their full potential.</p>
              <p>Any character proficient with martial weapons is also proficient with these firearms. Additionally, rogues and bards are proficient with the pistol.</p>

            <div class="col-5 col-m-12">
              <h4>The Primes</h4>
              <p>Religion in the Core Lands of Aether revolves around a pantheon of eight deities known as the Prime Dragons, or the Primes for short. Much like in the ancient Greek and Roman religions, these deities preside over various concepts in nature and civilization.</p>
              <p>They are generally worshiped as a collective whole rather than professing devotion to a single Prime. Individual prayers tend to be devoted to the Prime most relevant to the situation; for example, sailors praying for good weather would pray to Rydion, while a family grieving the loss of a loved one and desire for protection in the afterlife would pray to Ilios.</p>
              <p>Clerics operate slightly differently, here. A Cleric does hold a particular Prime as his or her patron, and thus he or she strives to emulate and promote that Prime's ideals. The Cleric is not limited to worshiping only that Prime however; the divine power of Clerics comes from all of the Primes.</p>
