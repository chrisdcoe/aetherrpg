            <h3>Human</h3>
            <img class="img-tabs" src="img/races/human.jpg" alt="Human">
            <p>The humans of Aether are a diverse mix of people. Some are fair-skinned and some are dark; some are strong while others are bookish. Compared to other races, humans don't particularly excel in anything, but they are very adaptable.</p>
            <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
            <p>Two different ability scores of your choice each increase by 2.</p>
            <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
            <p><span class="bold">Size</span>: Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Languages</span>: You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Skilled</span>: You gain proficiency in two skills and one tool proficiency of your choice.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Extra Feat</span>: You gain one feat of your choice.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="tabs-gno" class="row">
            <h3>Gnoll</h3>
            <img class="img-tabs" src="img/races/gnoll.jpg" alt="Gnoll">
            <p>Gnolls are often seen as the outcasts of society. They still remember an ancient feud with the humans, one that was never fully resolved. As a result, there's a prejudice about gnolls being bandits, pirates, and thugs. Though many gnolls do fit this stereotype, many others have come to live among the other races.</p>
            <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
            <p>Your Strength score increases by 2. Your Constitution score and one other ability score of your choice each increase by 1.</p>
            <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
            <p><span class="bold">Size</span>: Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Languages</span>: You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnollish.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Fierce Hunter</span>: You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, or Survival.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Darkvision</span>: You have
              superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can
              see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright
              light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't
              discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Keen Senses</span>: You have advantage on Perception checks that rely on hearing or smell.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Rampage</span>: When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an attack on your turn, you can take a bonus action to move up to half your speed and make one weapon attack.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="tabs-kob" class="row">
            <h3>Kobold</h3>
            <img class="img-tabs" src="img/races/kobold.jpg" alt="Kobold">
            <p>Kobolds are a diminutive race of reptilians with vaguely dragon-like features. Unsurprisingly, kobolds themselves like to claim they're related to dragons. They come in a wide variety of colors, both chromatic and metallic. Kobolds tend to have a strong bond with their clan since traditionally they have believed in safety in numbers. Kobolds are often restless, constantly coming up with new ideas, plans, and schemes. They're also notoriously cowardly. Not many become adventurers, but those who do are eager to prove their worth to their companions.</p>
            <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
            <p>Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Your Intelligence score and one other ability score of your choice each increase by 1.</p>
            <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
            <p><span class="bold">Size</span>: Your size is Small.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Languages</span>: You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Crafty</span>: You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Investigation, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Darkvision</span>: You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p> 
            <p><span class="bold">Draconic Resistance</span>: You have resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Naturally Stealthy</span>: You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="tabs-liz" class="row">
            <h3>Lizardfolk</h3>
            <img class="img-tabs" src="img/races/lizan.jpg" alt="Lizardfolk">
            <p>Lizardfolk tend to congregate around wet climates. Islands with an abundance of water crystals will often have a lizan settlement nearby. They are a sturdy folk who exhibit a seemingly emotionally-detached demeanor.</p>
            <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
            <p>Your Constitution score increases by 2. Your Wisdom score and one other ability score of your choice each increase by 1.</p>
            <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
            <p><span class="bold">Size</span>: Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Languages</span>: You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Hunter's Lore</span>: You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Aquatic</span>: You can hold your breath for 15 minutes at a time. You also have a swimming speed of 30 feet.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Cunning Artisan</span>: As part of a short rest, you can harvest bone and hide from a slain beast, construct, dragon, monstrosity, or plant creature of size Small or larger to create one of the following items: a shield, a club, a javelin, or 1d4 darts or blowgun needles. (Your DM may allow you to create other items.) To use this trait, you need a blade, such as a dagger, or appropriate artisan's tools, such as leatherworker's tools.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Natural Armor</span>: You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="tabs-min" class="row">
            <h3>Minotaur</h3>
            <img class="img-tabs" src="img/races/minotaur.jpg" alt="Minotaur">
            <p>Minotaurs are right at home on the plains. They have overcome a brutal, savage history and tend to live as farmers and nomads living off the land. Don't underestimate them, however; an angry minotaur is still a fearsome foe.</p>
            <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
            <p>Your Wisdom score increases by 2. Your Strength score and one other ability score of your choice each increase by 1.</p>
            <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
            <p><span class="bold">Size</span>: Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Languages</span>: You can speak, read, and write Common and Tauric.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Naturalist</span>: You are proficient in your choice of one of the following skills: Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, or Nature.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Powerful Build</span>: You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Labyrinthine Recall</span>: You can perfectly recall any path you have traveled. </p>
            <p><span class="bold">Charger</span>: When you use your action to Dash, you can use a bonus action to make one weapon attack or to shove a creature. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taking this bonus action, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attack's damage roll (if you chose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to shove and you succeed).</p>
          </div>

          <div id="tabs-rat" class="row">
            <h3>Ratling</h3>
            <img class="img-tabs" src="img/races/ratling.jpg" alt="Ratling">
            <p>The ratlings are naturally inquisitive and inventive. These small folk have produced some of the finest scholars in the realm. So intense is their passion for learning that their capital itself strongly resembles a university.</p>
            <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
            <p>Your Intelligence score increases by 2. Your Charisma score and one other ability score of your choice each increase by 1.</p>
            <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
            <p><span class="bold">Size</span>: Your size is Small.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Languages</span>: You can speak, read, and write Common and Ratatat.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Loremaster</span>: You are proficient in your choice of one of the following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Expertise</span>: Choose one skill in which you have proficiency. You gain expertise with that skill, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it. The skill you choose must be one that isn't already benefiting from a feature, such as Expertise, that doubles your proficiency bonus.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Cantrip</span>: You know one of the following cantrips: Druidcraft, Prestidigitation, or Thaumaturgy.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Nimbleness</span>: You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="tabs-ten" class="row">
            <h3>Tengu</h3>
            <img class="img-tabs" src="img/races/Tengu.jpg" alt="Tengu">
            <p>The Tengu are a race of flightless bird-people. They most commonly resemble parrots or crows, though Tengu of all shapes and sizes can be found. They possess an uncanny gift for socializing and have ingratiated themselves into all parts of society around the core lands. Historical records suggest the Tengu lacked a culture of their own prior to The Calamity, so modern Tengu culture is largely a blend of other races' traditions but with a unique flair.</p>
            <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
            <p>Your Charisma score increases by 2. Your Dexterity score and one other ability score of your choice each increase by 1.</p>
            <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
            <p><span class="bold">Size</span>: Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Languages</span>: You can speak, read, and write Common and Auran.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Glide</span>: You can use your reaction when you fall to slow your rate of descent to 60 feet per round. If you land within one minute, you take no falling damage and land on your feet.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Mimicry</span>: You can mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Deception) check.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Lucky</span>: When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can re-roll the die and must use the new roll.</p>

            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duo Reges: constructio interrete. Sed vos squalidius, illorum vides quam niteat oratio. Quae enim adhuc protulisti, popularia sunt, ego autem a te elegantiora desidero. Neminem videbis ita laudatum, ut artifex callidus comparandarum voluptatum diceretur. Sed quid sentiat, non videtis. Ubi ut eam caperet aut quando?</p>

            <p>Addidisti ad extremum etiam indoctum fuisse. Ita ne hoc quidem modo paria peccata sunt. Tum mihi Piso: Quid ergo? Cur igitur, inquam, res tam dissimiles eodem nomine appellas? Miserum hominem! Si dolor summum malum est, dici aliter non potest. Ita prorsus, inquam; Expressa vero in iis aetatibus, quae iam confirmatae sunt.

Naturales divitias dixit parabiles esse, quod parvo esset natura contenta. In his igitur partibus duabus nihil erat, quod Zeno commutare gestiret.
