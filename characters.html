            <h3>Humans</h3>
            <img class="img-tabs" src="img/races/human.jpg" alt="Human">
            <p>The humans of Aether are a diverse mix of people. Some are fair-skinned and some are dark; some are strong while others are bookish. Compared to other races, humans don't particularly excel in anything, but they are very adaptable.</p>
            <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
            <p>Two different ability scores of your choice each increase by 2.</p>
            <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
            <p><span class="bold">Languages</span>: You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Skills</span>: You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Feat</span>: You gain one feat of your choice.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="tabs-liz" class="row">
            <h3>Lizardfolk</h3>
            <img class="img-tabs" src="img/races/lizan.jpg" alt="Lizardfolk">
            <p>Lizardfolk tend to congregate around wet climates. Islands with an abundance of water crystals will often have a lizan settlement nearby. They are a sturdy folk who exhibit a seemingly emotionally-detached demeanor.</p>
            <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
            <p>Your Wisdom and Constitution scores each increase by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 2. Your Charisma score decreases by 2.</p>
            <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
            <p><span class="bold">Languages</span>: You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Aquatic</span>: You can hold your breath for 15 minutes at a time. You also have a swimming speed of 30 feet.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Bite</span>: Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Hungry Jaws</span>: In battle, you can throw yourself into a vicious feeding frenzy. As a bonus action, you can make a special attack with your bite. If the attack hits, it deals its normal damage, and you gain temporary hit points (minimum of 1) equal to your Constitution modifier, and you can't use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Cunning Artisan</span>: As part of a short rest, you can harvest bone and hide from a slain beast, construct, dragon, monstrosity, or plant creature of size Small or larger to create one of the following items: a shield, a club, a javelin, or 1d4 darts or blowgun needles. (Your DM may allow you to create other items.) To use this trait, you need a blade, such as a dagger, or appropriate artisan's tools, such as leatherworker's tools.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Hunter's Lore</span>: You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Natural Armor</span>: You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="tabs-kob" class="row">
            <h3>Kobold</h3>
            <img class="img-tabs" src="img/races/kobold.jpg" alt="Kobold">
            <p>Kobolds are a diminutive race of reptilians with vaguely dragon-like features. Unsurprisingly, kobolds themselves like to claim they're related to dragons. They come in a wide variety of colors, both chromatic and metallic. Kobolds tend to have a strong bond with their clan since traditionally they have believed in safety in numbers. Kobolds are often restless, constantly coming up with new ideas, plans, and schemes. They're also notoriously cowardly. Not many become adventurers, but those who do are eager to prove their worth to their companions.</p>
            <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
            <p>Your Dexterity and Intelligence scores each increase by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 2. Your Strength score decreases by 2.</p>
            <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
            <p><span class="bold">Languages</span>: You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Darkvision</span>: You have
            superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can
            see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright
            light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't
            discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Kobold Advantage</span>: Kobolds have advantage on all attacks, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Cowardice</span>: Despite their obvious superiority, kobolds run away from conflict all the time.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">ZZZ</span>: ZZZ.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="tabs-min" class="row">
            <h3>Minotaurs</h3>
            <img class="img-tabs" src="img/races/minotaur.jpg" alt="Minotaur">
            <p>Minotaurs are right at home on the plains. They have overcome a brutal, savage history and tend to live as farmers and nomads living off the land. Don't underestimate them, however; an angry minotaur is still a fearsome foe.</p>
            <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
            <p>Your Strength and Constitution scores each increase by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 2. Your Dexterity score decreases by 2.</p>
            <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
            <p><span class="bold">Languages</span>: You can speak, read, and write Common and Tauric.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Horns</span>: You are never unarmed. You are
            proficient with your horns, which are a melee
            weapon that deals 1d10 piercing damage. Your
            horns grant you advantage on all checks made to
            shove a creature, but not to avoid being shoved
            yourself.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Goring Rush</span>: When you use the Dash action
            during your turn, you can make a melee attack
            with your horns as a bonus action.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Hammering Horns</span>: When you use the Attack
            action during your turn to make a melee attack,
            you can attempt to shove a creature with your
            horns as a bonus action. You cannot use this
            shove attempt to knock a creature prone.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Labyrinthine Recall</span>: You can perfectly recall
            any path you have traveled. </p>
            <p><span class="bold">Herbalism</span>: You gain proficiency with herbalism kits.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="tabs-gno" class="row">
            <h3>Gnolls</h3>
            <img class="img-tabs" src="img/races/gnoll.jpg" alt="Gnoll">
            <p>Gnolls are often seen as the outcasts of society. They still remember an ancient feud with the humans, one that was never fully resolved. As a result, there's a prejudice about gnolls being bandits, pirates, and thugs. Though many gnolls do fit this stereotype, many others have come to live among the other races.</p>
            <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
            <p>Your Strength and Dexterity scores each increase by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 2. Your Intelligence score decreases by 2.</p>
            <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
            <p><span class="bold">Languages</span>: You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Darkvision</span>: You have
            superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can
            see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright
            light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't
            discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Menacing</span>: You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Relentless Endurance</span>: When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Savage Attacks</span>: When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="tabs-rat" class="row">
            <h3>Ratlings</h3>
            <img class="img-tabs" src="img/races/ratling.jpg" alt="Ratling">
            <p>The ratlings are naturally inquisitive and inventive. These small folk have produced some of the finest scholars in the realm. So intense is their passion for learning that their capital itself strongly resembles a university.</p>
            <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
            <p>Your Intelligence and Charisma scores each increase by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 2. Your Wisdom score decreases by 2.</p>
            <h4>Racial Traits</h4>

            <p><span class="bold">Darkvision</span>: You have
            superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can
            see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright
            light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't
            discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Cunning</span>: You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Artificer's Lore</span>: Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Industrious</span>: You have proficiency with one artisan's tool of your choice. When crafting using this tool, you can work twice as fast: you make crafting progress in 10-gp increments instead of 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of that item.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="tabs-ken" class="row">
            <h3>Kenku</h3>
            <img class="img-tabs" src="img/races/kenku.jpg" alt="Kenku">
            <p>The Kenku are a race of flightless bird-people who take after ravens and crows. They possess an uncanny gift for socializing and have ingratiated themselves into all parts of society around the core lands. Historical records suggest the Kenku lacked a culture of their own prior to The Calamity, so modern Kenku culture is largely a blend of other races' traditions but with a unique flair. One such tradition is the art of Kenku swordplay, which is said to be based on the graceful, flowing style employed by the long-lost Elves.</p>
            <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
            <p>Your Charisma and Wisdom scores each increase by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 2. Your Constitution score decreases by 2.</p>
            <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
            <p><span class="bold">Languages</span>: You can speak, read, and write Common and Auran.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Mimicry</span>: You can mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Deception) check.</p>

            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duo Reges: constructio interrete. Sed vos squalidius, illorum vides quam niteat oratio. Quae enim adhuc protulisti, popularia sunt, ego autem a te elegantiora desidero. Neminem videbis ita laudatum, ut artifex callidus comparandarum voluptatum diceretur. Sed quid sentiat, non videtis. Ubi ut eam caperet aut quando?</p>

            <p>Addidisti ad extremum etiam indoctum fuisse. Ita ne hoc quidem modo paria peccata sunt. Tum mihi Piso: Quid ergo? Cur igitur, inquam, res tam dissimiles eodem nomine appellas? Miserum hominem! Si dolor summum malum est, dici aliter non potest. Ita prorsus, inquam; Expressa vero in iis aetatibus, quae iam confirmatae sunt.

Naturales divitias dixit parabiles esse, quod parvo esset natura contenta. In his igitur partibus duabus nihil erat, quod Zeno commutare gestiret.
