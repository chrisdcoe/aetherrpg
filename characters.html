            <img class="img-tabs" src="img/lizard.jpg">
            <p>Lizardfolk tend to congregate around wet climates. Islands with an abundance of water crystals will often have a lizardfolk settlement nearby. They are a sturdy folk who exhibit a seemingly emotionally-detached demeanor.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Bite</span>: Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Hungry Jaws</span>: In battle, you can throw yourself into a vicious feeding frenzy. As a bonus action, you can make a special attack with your bite.

            <p>Minotaurs are right at home on the plains. They have overcome a brutal, savage history and tend to live as farmers and nomads living off the land. Don't underestimate them, however; an angry minotaur is still a fearsome foe.</p>

            discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
